//Object
// represents a concrete, maybe real-world thing
//instance of a class (in java)
// a unit/structure in a program that
// has state (data/fields)
//has operations/functions/methods
// Class
// a blueprint/template/model for creating objects
// are data types, and instances of a class have that class as the datatype
// define the structure of all instance (i.e., object) of that class
//      field names and types
//      methods signatures (signatures = names and parameters)
//Can overload a method (multiple methods with the same name)
// The name has to be the same, the signature has to be different in the parameter list
//Constructors
//Special method with no return type, named the same as the class
// that is responsible for initializing the state of an object/instance
// if we don't write one, java compiler provides a Default Constructor (zero arguments)
//instantiation
// process of creating an instance of the class (object)
// FiniteCan can1 = new FiniteCan(10)
// new means creating new instance of the class

// private String flavor;
//encapsulated field (data contained in object, private allows us to control access)
// encapsulation makes things privates

/*Getter Methods/Observer - observe but not change the state*/
/* Mutator/Setter methods - allow us to change the state*/

//Interface
//Parent Class inherits everything that isn't private, only shows methods
//UML Notes
//Inheritance
// "is a"
//Page Class and Book Composite extends or inherits from BookComponent
// encapsulation
// "has a/some"
// BookCompositive
// contains one/more Book Components
// + means public, - means private
//Stack(PringlesCan)
// sequence of data
// only access one end (top)
// LIF() (Last in first out)
// push pop, getTop

// Queue (CandyRoll)
// sequence of data
// access both ends, not in the middle
// FIFO (first in, first out)
//overide
